# Public Datasets

<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="../images/data_icons_gfd.png">

### [Global Flood Database](https://global-flood-database.cloudtostreet.ai/)
The Global Flood Database (GFD) combines over 15 years of flood data to create the first comprehensive satellite-based resource for global flood risk management and mitigation. With funding from Google Earth Outreach and collaboration with flood mapping experts at Cloud to Street and the DFO Flood Observatory, we combined 15+ years of flood data with human settlement data to create a comprehensive database for researchers, humanitarian workers, and community organizations. You can view or access the flood exposure data via the [GFD website](https://global-flood-database.cloudtostreet.ai/) or through the [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/GLOBAL_FLOOD_DB_MODIS_EVENTS_V1) catalog. For detail on the dataset, methods and findings see our [Nature paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03695-w).

# Sullivan Lab Datasets
Our research team has developed a variety of different data products related to agriculture and flooding using satellite imagery and household surveys. We are very interested in collaborating with others to use these datasets to answer different questions related to food systems, flood expsoure or recovery or sustainable development more broadly. If you are interested in collaborating and using any of these datasets for your research, please send me an email (jasullivan@arizona.edu) with a short description of your research project.



### Household Surveys - Large-Scale Land Acquisitions (LSLAs)
Description coming soon.



### Property Boundaries - Large-Scale Land Acquisitions (LSLAs) in Tanzania
Description coming soon.
