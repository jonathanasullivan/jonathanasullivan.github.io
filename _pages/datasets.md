At the 2019 rendition of E3, an eccentric gamer in attendance interrupted Keanu Reeves' presentation of the role-playing game (RPG) Cyberpunk 2077, loudly claiming, “"You're breathtaking,"” which was directed at the actor-cum-presenter. The image macro used to build the "You're Breathtaking" meme generally features a still of Keanu Reeves pointing at someone in the audience in front of him - that someone is Peter Sark, though there are no images from Keanu's point of view that have since been used as part of the "You're Breathtaking" meme.
