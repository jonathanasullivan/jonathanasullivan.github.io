### Global Flood Database
The Global Flood Database (GFD) combines over 15 years of flood data to create the first comprehensive satellite-based resource for global flood risk management and mitigation. With funding from Google Earth Outreach and collaboration with flood mapping experts at Cloud to Street and the DFO Flood Observatory, we combined 15+ years of flood data with human settlement data to create a comprehensive database for researchers, humanitarian workers, and community organizations. You can view or access the data via the [GFD website](https://global-flood-database.cloudtostreet.ai/) or through the [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/GLOBAL_FLOOD_DB_MODIS_EVENTS_V1) catalog. For detail on the dataset, methods and findings see our [Nature paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03695-w).
