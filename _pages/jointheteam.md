I am looking for motivated students (from undergraduates to graduate students) who are interested in using a combination of remote sensing, household surveys, and statistical modeling to examine issues related to sustainable agriculture and adaptation to environmental change. I have current projects in Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zambia, and the United States, and I am open to students working in other regions. 

__Postdoc__ - I currently do not have any opportunities for postdocs at this time.

__PhD__ -  If you are interested in applying to start Fall '23, please send me an email with your research interests and a CV.
