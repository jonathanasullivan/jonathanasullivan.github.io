I am looking for motivated students (from undergraduates to graduate students) who are interested in using a combination of remote sensing, household surveys, and statistical modeling to examine issues related to agriculture, flood risk and environmental change with a focus on inequality. I have current projects in Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zambia, and the United States, and I am open to students working in other regions. I am always looking to work with new people, so please get in touch via my email address if you’re potentially interested!

For specific opportunities coming up in the next year, see below. 

### :rotating_light: PhD :rotating_light:

I am recruiting candidates for a fully-funded PhD study in human-environment geography to begin in Fall 2023. Candidates interested in quantitative and qualitative research on the relationships between agriculture, climate, land tenure, food systems and food security - particularly with a focus in low- and middle-income countries are esepecially welcome to apply. A Bachelor's or Master's degree or significant coursework in natural or environmental social sciences is preferable, but not required, as is relevant research and/or professional experience.


### Postdoc 
I currently do not have any opportunities for postdocs at this time.
