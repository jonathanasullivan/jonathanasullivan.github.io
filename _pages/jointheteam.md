I am always looking to work with new people from undergraduates to graduate students who are interested in using a combination of remote sensing, household surveys, and statistical modeling to examine issues related to agriculture, flood risk and environmental change. I have current projects in Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zambia, and the United States, and I am open to students working in other regions. Please get in touch via my email address if youâ€™re interested!

For specific opportunities coming up in the next year, see below. 

### PhD (Seeking PhD for Fall '23)

I am recruiting candidates for a fully-funded PhD study in human-environment geography to begin in Fall 2023. Candidates interested in quantitative and qualitative research on the relationships between agriculture, climate, land tenure, food systems and food security - particularly with a focus in low- and middle-income countries are esepecially welcome to apply. A Bachelor's or Master's degree or significant coursework in natural or environmental social sciences is preferable, but not required, as is relevant research and/or professional experience.


### Postdoc 
I currently do not have any opportunities for postdocs at this time.
