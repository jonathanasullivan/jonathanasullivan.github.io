I am looking for motivated students (from undergraduates to graduate students) who are interested in using a combination of remote sensing, household surveys, and statistical modeling to examine issues related to agriculture, flood risk and environmental change with a focus on inequality. I have current projects in Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zambia, and the United States, and I am open to students working in other regions. I am always looking to work with new people, so please get in touch via my email address if youâ€™re potentially interested!
