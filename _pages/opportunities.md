I am always looking to work with new people from undergraduates to graduate students who are interested in using a combination of remote sensing, household surveys, and statistical modeling to examine issues related to agriculture, flood risk and environmental change. I have current projects in Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zambia, and the United States, and I am open to students working in other regions. Please get in touch via email if youâ€™re interested!

For specific opportunities coming up in the next year, see below. 


## Seeking PhD Candidate for Fall '24
I am recruiting candidates for a fully funded PhD study in human-environment geography to begin in Fall 2024. For a full description of the opportunity see this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rhElXer1becXgu3_VJyvnFy4jGtDdnDI/view?usp=sharing).

The selected candidate will work as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) on developing a flood archive database for the United States from 2000 to present using satellite imagery and deep learning. Candidates interested in quantitative and qualitative research on topics of flood exposure/ recovery, agriculture, food security, or climate adaptation are especially welcome to apply. Prior degrees or significant coursework in remote sensing, programming, computer science, natural or environmental social sciences is preferable, but not required, as is relevant research and/or professional experience. To enter the School of Geography, Development and Environment's PhD program a Master's degree is required.

For a full description of the opportunity see this link. Interested candidates should send me an email with your CV, a writing sample you are proud of (doesn't have to be an article) and a paragraph on your research interest as a PhD student. For details on the application, visit the School of Geography, Development and Environment (SGDE) [website](https://geography.arizona.edu/maphd-program/apply) (deadline January 5th).


## Postdoc 
I currently do not have any funded opportunities for postdocs at this time. However, I'm always eager to hear from exceptional scholars eager to join the lab as postdocs or scientists. I encourage potential postdocs to contact me to discuss internal and external funding opportunities including the [University of Arizona's President's Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://presidentspostdoc.arizona.edu/), [US Fulbright Programs (for EU citizens)](https://www.fulbrightschuman.eu/grants-eu-citizens/post-doctoral-research/), or [NSF's SBE Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/sbe-postdoctoral-research-fellowships-sprf).
