I am always looking to work with new people from undergraduates to graduate students who are interested in using a combination of remote sensing, household surveys, and statistical modeling to examine issues related to agriculture, flood risk and environmental change. I have current projects in Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zambia, and the United States, and I am open to students working in other regions. Please get in touch via email if youâ€™re interested!

For specific opportunities coming up in the next year, see below.

The University of Arizona SGDE program accepts PhD applications on an annual basis on Jan 5th. You can learn more about the MA/PhD program at SGDE [here](https://geography.arizona.edu/maphd-program/apply).

## Postdoc 
I currently do not have any funded opportunities for postdocs at this time. However, I'm always eager to hear from exceptional scholars eager to join the lab as postdocs or scientists. I encourage potential postdocs to contact me to discuss internal and external funding opportunities including the [University of Arizona's President's Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://presidentspostdoc.arizona.edu/), [US Fulbright Programs (for EU citizens)](https://www.fulbrightschuman.eu/grants-eu-citizens/post-doctoral-research/), or [NSF's SBE Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/sbe-postdoctoral-research-fellowships-sprf).
